# BirdLogger
This application was built with Bird watchers in mind. 
The function of this app is to allow bird watchers to log an event of a bird sighting with certian criteria. 
The criteria include and ID number, Type of bird, location, size, color and activity. 
Along side of the Birdlogger you can also log a nest if sighted too. 
The last function is the ability to write a Journal entry associated with the Bird.
Happy bird watching!
